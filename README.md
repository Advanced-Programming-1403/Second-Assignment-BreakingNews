# Second Assignment: Breaking News 📰
**Welcome to Your Second Assignment in the Advanced Programming Course!**

In this assignment, you will develop a Java application that functions as a simple news aggregator. Your task is to fetch real-time news data from **"News API"** and present the latest headlines in an organized manner. This project will help you gain hands-on experience with API integration and data handling.
## Objectives ✏️
By completing this assignment, you will:

- Reinforce your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and apply them effectively.
- Gain familiarity with the process of issuing HTTP requests to APIs and parsing JSON data in Java.
- Learn to manage and track changes in your project using Git.
## Prerequisites ✅
Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 23
- Git
- Gradle as a package manager
## Tasks 📝
1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch named develop and switch to it. All development should be done in this branch.
3. Get an API key from https://newsapi.org. You need to create an account first.
4. Design News class with appropriate methods and attributes. Complete the methods in the code and add at least one new attribute for the class, then write a new method to get the attribute's proper value using JSON string.
5. Implement a menu in your Main class. This menu should contain the titles of news. The user should be able to choose the desired article to read more information about it.

6. Add error handling to handle cases where the API returns an error or the information is not found.
7. Write a comprehensive report detailing the tasks you have completed and any challenges you encountered. **Your report should be written in Markdown format.** You can write your report in the provided Report-Template.md file located within the repository, which serves as a simple template for structuring your report.
8. Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.
9. Submit a pull request from your develop branch to your main branch. Your mentor will review the pull request and merge it upon approval.
## Evaluation 📃
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Your code should pass all the tests provided in the test directory.
- Error-free compilation and execution of your code. 
- Accurate retrieval and presentation of movie and actor data through the methods written.
- Clear code structure, readability, thorough commenting, and adherence to clean code principles.
